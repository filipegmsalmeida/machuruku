# machuruku
Welcome to our page for Machuruku, our R package for phylogenetic niche modeling. Machuruku uses a modified Bioclim niche-modeling method and ancestral character estimation to reconstruct ancestral niches. Input data consists of present-day climate rasters, a time-calibrated phylogeny, and taxon occurrence data for all tips. Ancestral niche models can be projected into additionally provided paleoclimate data to visualize the geographic origins of a lineage. 
To install Machuruku, simply run the following in R:
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wxguillo/machuruku")
```
For both quick and detailed tutorials on how to use Machuruku, please visit the [tutorial page](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/tree/main/tutorial) in this repository.
